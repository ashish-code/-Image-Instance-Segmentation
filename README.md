# -Image-Instance-Segmentation
Segmentation and classification of multiple visual objects in an image or video frame. Preliminary results based on Mask R-CNN built with Inception V2 as classification foundation. Trained on class labels from the MSCOCO dataset. Subsequently, the fidelity of the silhouette and the visual object will be progressively improved using GAN a based approach to accurately eliminate any background clutter in the extracted object mask.
